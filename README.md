# Weather Dashboard


## Description

I created this web application for users to be able to view their cities weather forecast. The forecast includes the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed.

Users are also able to view future weather conditions for that city.

## Usage
Simply type in the city you would like a forecast for and press the search button, you will then be presented with a future and current forecast of that city.
